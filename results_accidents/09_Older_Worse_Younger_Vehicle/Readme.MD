# Old drivers worse than the young one and *Vehicle* group

After 5 iterations we get 39 true SD4ft-rules.

## The results can be summarised this way: 

+ For medium vehicle ages (approx. 4-10), the probability of a Fatal accident is 1.4-1.7 times higher for older than for younger
30 rules have Vehicle_Type(Pedal cycle).
+ For Pedal cycles, the probability of a Serious accident is approx. 1.6 times higher for older than for younger. 




## Additional induced analytical questions can be formulated:  

+ Other circumstances could be analyzed.
