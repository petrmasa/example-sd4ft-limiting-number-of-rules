# Young drivers worse than the old one and *Conditions* group

After 5 iterations we get 45 true SD4ft-rules.

## The results can be summarised this way: 

+ 35 rules has Area(1,Urban).
+ 16 rules has Light(4,Darkness - lights lit).
+ 19 rules has Manoeuvre(18,Going ahead other).
+ 24 rules has Road\_Type(6,Single carriageway).
+ 27 rules has a Speed Limit 20 or 30.



## Additional induced analytical questions can be formulated:  

+ Are there some other circumstances where fatal accidents occur more for younger than older?
