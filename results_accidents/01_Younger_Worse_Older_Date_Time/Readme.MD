# Young drivers worse than the old one and *Date_Time* group

After 5 iterations we get 41 true SD4ft-rules.

## The results can be summarised this way: 

+ Algorithm found several individual rules, individual rules should be investigated by the subject matter expert, find circumstances (e.g unexpected ice on road) and use it directly or in further analysis.
+ 16 rules are within morning (9-10) or late evening (22-23) time slots.
+ The only thing that is common is that younger rules contain 1 or 2 categories but for older more categories. This confirms business knowledge that young drivers are riskier.


## Additional induced analytical questions can be formulated:  

+ Analysis on serious/fatal accidents could be started.
+ Can we generalize these rules to the only day of the week and hour?
