# Young drivers worse than the old one and *Vehicle* group

After 4 iterations we get 37 true SD4ft-rules.

## The results can be summarised this way: 

+ Vehicle type Pedal Cycle and typically older vehicles have>1.4 times higher probability of Slight severity accident for younger over older.  
+ For older vehicles (13 years and older), the risk of Fatal accidents is 1.3-1.4 times higher for younger than for older.



## Additional induced analytical questions can be formulated:  

+ What are other types of vehicles where there is a difference between young and old people?
